  Erugo is a powerful, self-hosted file-sharing platform built with PHP and Laravel with a Vue.js frontend. It offers secure, customisable file-transfer capabilities through an elegant user interface, giving you complete control over your data while providing a seamless experience for both senders and recipients.

  Check out a sample share on our demo site at demo.erugo.app/shares/tight-silence-sweet-sea. While uploads are disabled on the demo, you can experience the recipient's view and download the sample file.
